**Problem.** Inconsistent device baselines and missing inventory fields caused drift.

**Approach.**
1. MDM baseline definition: passcode, encryption, OS minimums, sensitive toggles.
2. Smart groups for drift detection; remediation scripts for common issues.
3. Reporting pipeline exporting key fields for weekly review.

**Results.** Reduced drift, improved visibility, and faster exception handling.

**Next.** Add log shipping for richer posture analytics.
